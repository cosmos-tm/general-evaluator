I've always regretted not mentioning this in one of your earlier speeches, but I thought when you were calm you are a great speaker! Your earlier speech when you were calm reminded me of only a handful of professors that had a great story telling ability. I specifically sought out their courses for their lectures, and I had thought you reminded me of them",
